# mod5 Project
This processor was made in the context of a electrical engineering project for the university of Twente. The code is written and tested on an Altera DE1-SoC. All the code  is released under the GPL. 

For running it on a FPGA the Quartus files inside the quartus directory for the right fpga board are needed. Also the vhdl files in the VHDL/all directory are needed for the Quartus compilation.
