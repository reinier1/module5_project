Before signals are passed to the memory they are passed through a controller, 
which will create the right byte enable signals and shift the lower 8-bits 
to the correct location when writing a byte. 
Signals are then intercepted so debug can also read and write memory and IO can be used.

Input byte or word
Input write enable or read enable
