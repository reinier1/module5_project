Before signals are passed to the memory they are passed through a controller, 
which will create the right byte enable signals and shift the lower 8-bits 
to the correct location when writing a byte. 
Signals are then intercepted so debug can also read and write memory and IO can be used.

Input byte or word
Input write enable or read enable
Data address
Data to processor
Output byte enable lines
Output read memory

32-bits wide input
32-bits address in
14-bits address out + 4 byte enable
